1.
Concurrency - the property of program, algorithm, or problem decomposition into order-independent or partially-ordered units.

Parallelism - many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously

Difference - Parallelism implementation of concurrency. Concurrency = overlapping time periods, Parallelism = simultaneously

2.
Increase of parallelism / faster computation.

3.
Reduce waiting, improve throughput, resource utizliation, average reponse time

4.
Harder

5.
Processes - 
Threads - 
Green Threads - 
Coroutines -
